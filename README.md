1) I created a project LongestWord
 Created a class FindLongestWordEx
-In th class created a method called FindLongestWordAndLength which returns string array with a length of "2".
-So, the first value in the string array value will be length of the longest word.
- Second value will be longest word.
- Created a Junit test class for both positive and negative to verify it is passed.

There are two ways to test:
1) Through Main class "FindLongestWordEx.java"
2) Through Junit calss "FindLongestWordExTest.java"
